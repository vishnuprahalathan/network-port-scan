# 🛡️ Cyber Security Internship – Task 1: Port Scanning

## 🎯 Objective
To discover open ports in the local network and understand the risks of exposed services using **Nmap** and **Wireshark**.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org)
- [Wireshark](https://wireshark.org)
- Terminal/Command Prompt

## 🧪 Steps Performed
1. Identified local IP range
2. Performed TCP SYN scan using `nmap -sS`
3. Saved results in both text and HTML formats
4. (Optional) Captured packets with Wireshark
5. Analyzed open ports and mapped to services
6. Researched potential vulnerabilities

## 🧾 Results
- Found X devices on network
- Open ports and services noted
- See `scan_results.txt` and `scan_report.html`

## 📚 Key Learnings
- Learned how attackers map networks using Nmap
- Understood how Wireshark captures traffic for deeper analysis
- Gained insight into services like SSH, FTP, SMB, and their risks
